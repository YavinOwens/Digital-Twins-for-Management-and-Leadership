## Technical Implementation

### Agent Creation Pattern
```python
def create_tender_response_agents_with_context(
    llm, 
    conversation_history: Optional[List[Any]] = None, 
    use_tools: bool = True
) -> dict:
    """
    Create Tender Response team agents with context
    
    Args:
        llm: Language model instance
        conversation_history: Previous conversation context
        use_tools: Enable tool usage for agents
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing agent instances
    """
    # Agent creation logic
    agents = {
        'tender_specialist': create_tender_response_specialist(llm, use_tools),
        'proposal_writer': create_proposal_writer(llm, use_tools),
        'compliance_expert': create_compliance_expert(llm, use_tools)
    }
    
    return agents
```

### Task Creation Pattern
```python
def create_tender_response_tasks_with_data(
    tender_specialist,
    proposal_writer,
    compliance_expert,
    query: str,
    previous_team_data: str,
    conversation_history: Optional[List[Any]] = None
) -> List[Task]:
    """
    Create Tender Response team tasks with data
    
    Args:
        tender_specialist: Tender Response Specialist agent
        proposal_writer: Proposal Writer agent
        compliance_expert: Compliance Expert agent
        query: Tender response query
        previous_team_data: Information management frameworks from previous team
        conversation_history: Previous conversation context
        
    Returns:
        List of Task instances
    """
    # Task creation logic
    tasks = [
        create_tender_analysis_task(tender_specialist, query, previous_team_data, conversation_history),
        create_proposal_writing_task(proposal_writer, query, previous_team_data, conversation_history),
        create_compliance_verification_task(compliance_expert, query, previous_team_data, conversation_history)
    ]
    
    return tasks
```

### Error Handling
```python
def handle_tender_response_errors(error: Exception, context: str) -> str:
    """
    Handle tender response-specific errors with appropriate fallbacks
    
    Args:
        error: Exception that occurred
        context: Context where error occurred
        
    Returns:
        Error message or fallback response
    """
    if "tender" in str(error).lower():
        return "Tender analysis failed. Please check tender documents and requirements."
    elif "proposal" in str(error).lower():
        return "Proposal development failed. Please provide tender analysis data."
    elif "compliance" in str(error).lower():
        return "Compliance verification failed. Please check proposal content and requirements."
    else:
        return f"Tender Response error: {str(error)}"
```

## Integration Patterns

### Collaborative Processing
The team follows a collaborative processing pattern where agents work together to develop comprehensive tender responses:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Tender Response Specialist analyses requirements
2. **Writing Phase**: Proposal Writer develops strategic content
3. **Compliance Phase**: Compliance Expert verifies and validates

### Data Flow
```
Information Management Frameworks → Tender Response Specialist → Tender Analysis
                                                        ↓
Proposal Content ← Proposal Writer ← Tender Analysis
                                                        ↓
Compliance Verification ← Compliance Expert ← Proposal Content
```

### Context Passing
- Information management frameworks inform tender analysis
- Tender analysis guides proposal development
- Both analysis and proposal inform compliance verification

### Cross-Agent Dependencies
- Proposal Writer depends on tender analysis
- Compliance Expert depends on both analysis and proposal
- All agents share common tender and organisational context
