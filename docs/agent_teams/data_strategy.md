    use_tools: bool = True
) -> dict:

    data_governance_specialist,
    dcam_template_specialist,
    tranch_guidance_specialist,
    query: str,
    previous_team_data: str,

## Integration Patterns

### Collaborative Processing
The team follows a collaborative processing pattern where agents work together to develop comprehensive data strategy frameworks:

1. **Governance Phase**: Data Governance Specialist develops framework
2. **Assessment Phase**: DCAM Template Specialist creates evaluation methodology
3. **Implementation Phase**: Tranch Guidance Specialist develops roadmap

### Data Flow
```
Research Data → Data Governance Specialist → Governance Framework
                                        ↓
Assessment Methodology ← DCAM Template Specialist ← Governance Framework
                                        ↓
Implementation Roadmap ← Tranch Guidance Specialist ← Assessment Methodology
```

### Context Passing
- Research data informs governance framework development
- Governance framework guides DCAM assessment methodology
- Both frameworks inform implementation roadmap development

### Cross-Agent Dependencies
- DCAM Specialist depends on governance framework
- Tranch Specialist depends on both governance and DCAM frameworks
- All agents share common organisational context
