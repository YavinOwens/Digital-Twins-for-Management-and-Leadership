## Technical Implementation

### Agent Creation Pattern
```python
def create_research_analysis_agents_with_context(
    llm, 
    conversation_history: Optional[List[Any]] = None, 
    use_tools: bool = True
) -> dict:
    """
    Create Research & Analysis team agents with context
    
    Args:
        llm: Language model instance
        conversation_history: Previous conversation context
        use_tools: Enable tool usage for agents
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing agent instances
    """
    # Agent creation logic
    agents = {
        'researcher': create_research_specialist(llm, use_tools),
        'analyst': create_data_analyst(llm, use_tools),
        'writer': create_content_writer(llm, use_tools)
    }
    
    return agents
```

### Task Creation Pattern
```python
def create_research_analysis_tasks_with_data(
    researcher_agent,
    analyst_agent, 
    writer_agent,
    query: str,
    search_results: str,
    conversation_history: Optional[List[Any]] = None
) -> List[Task]:
    """
    Create Research & Analysis team tasks with data
    
    Args:
        researcher_agent: Research Specialist agent
        analyst_agent: Data Analyst agent
        writer_agent: Content Writer agent
        query: Research query
        search_results: Pre-search results
        conversation_history: Previous conversation context
        
    Returns:
        List of Task instances
    """
    # Task creation logic
    tasks = [
        create_research_task(researcher_agent, query, search_results, conversation_history),
        create_analysis_task(analyst_agent, query, conversation_history),
        create_writing_task(writer_agent, query, conversation_history)
    ]
    
    return tasks
```

### Error Handling
```python
def handle_research_errors(error: Exception, context: str) -> str:
    """
    Handle research-specific errors with appropriate fallbacks
    
    Args:
        error: Exception that occurred
        context: Context where error occurred
        
    Returns:
        Error message or fallback response
    """
    if "search" in str(error).lower():
        return "Research search failed. Please try a different query or check internet connection."
    elif "analysis" in str(error).lower():
        return "Analysis failed. Please provide more detailed research data."
    elif "writing" in str(error).lower():
        return "Content generation failed. Please check input data quality."
    else:
        return f"Research & Analysis error: {str(error)}"
```

## Integration Patterns

### Sequential Processing
The team follows a strict sequential processing pattern:

1. **Research Phase**: Research Specialist gathers data
2. **Analysis Phase**: Data Analyst processes research data
3. **Writing Phase**: Content Writer synthesises final report

### Data Flow
```
Query → Research Specialist → Research Data
                                ↓
Analysis Data ← Data Analyst ← Research Data
                                ↓
Final Report ← Content Writer ← Analysis Data
```

### Context Passing
- Research data passed to Data Analyst
- Analysis results passed to Content Writer
- Final report passed to next team in workflow

### Error Propagation
- Research errors prevent analysis execution
- Analysis errors prevent writing execution
- Writing errors prevent final output generation
