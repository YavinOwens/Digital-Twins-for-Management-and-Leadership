## Technical Implementation

### Agent Creation Pattern
```python
def create_compliance_risk_agents_with_context(
    llm, 
    conversation_history: Optional[List[Any]] = None, 
    use_tools: bool = True
) -> dict:
    """
    Create Compliance & Risk team agents with context
    
    Args:
        llm: Language model instance
        conversation_history: Previous conversation context
        use_tools: Enable tool usage for agents
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing agent instances
    """
    # Agent creation logic
    agents = {
        'compliance_specialist': create_compliance_specialist(llm, use_tools),
        'risk_management_specialist': create_risk_management_specialist(llm, use_tools),
        'audit_governance_specialist': create_audit_governance_specialist(llm, use_tools)
    }
    
    return agents
```

### Task Creation Pattern
```python
def create_compliance_risk_tasks_with_data(
    compliance_specialist,
    risk_management_specialist,
    audit_governance_specialist,
    query: str,
    previous_team_data: str,
    conversation_history: Optional[List[Any]] = None
) -> List[Task]:
    """

        risk_management_specialist: Risk Management Specialist agent
        audit_governance_specialist: Audit & Governance Specialist agent
        query: Compliance and risk query
        previous_team_data: Data strategy framework from previous team
        conversation_history: Previous conversation context
        
    Returns:
        List of Task instances
    """
    # Task creation logic
    tasks = [
        create_compliance_assessment_task(compliance_specialist, query, previous_team_data, conversation_history),
        create_risk_assessment_task(risk_management_specialist, query, previous_team_data, conversation_history),

    ]
    
    return tasks
```

### Error Handling

    Args:
        error: Exception that occurred
        context: Context where error occurred

        Error message or fallback response
    """
    if "compliance" in str(error).lower():
        return "Compliance framework development failed. Please check regulatory requirements."
    elif "risk" in str(error).lower():
        return "Risk assessment failed. Please provide comprehensive business context."
    elif "audit" in str(error).lower():
        return "Audit framework development failed. Please check compliance and risk data."
    else:
        return f"Compliance & Risk error: {str(error)}"
```

## Integration Patterns

### Collaborative Processing
The team follows a collaborative processing pattern where agents work together to develop comprehensive compliance and risk management frameworks:

1. **Compliance Phase**: Compliance Specialist develops framework
2. **Risk Phase**: Risk Management Specialist conducts assessment
3. **Governance Phase**: Audit & Governance Specialist develops oversight framework

### Data Flow
```
Data Strategy Framework → Compliance Specialist → Compliance Framework
                                            ↓
Risk Assessment ← Risk Management Specialist ← Compliance Framework
                                            ↓
Governance Framework ← Audit & Governance Specialist ← Risk Assessment
```

### Context Passing
- Data strategy framework informs compliance requirements
- Compliance framework guides risk assessment scope
- Both frameworks inform audit and governance development

### Cross-Agent Dependencies
- Risk Specialist depends on compliance framework
- Audit Specialist depends on both compliance and risk frameworks
- All agents share common regulatory and organisational context
