workforce training covers OHS. | None | Add periodic environmental impact assessments for each plant. |\n| **Social Value Framework (Public Sector)** | Requires measurable social benefits. | **Partially Compliant** – Workforce‑transformation includes reskilling and local hiring, but no formal social‑value measurement. | **Gap:** No social‑value KPI dashboard. | Define KPIs (e.g., % of staff reskilled, local employment %, community investment dollars) and embed in the change‑management plan. |\n| **Accessibility & Inclusive Design** | Digital interfaces for staff and partners. | **Compliant** – WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and inclusive training modules. | None | Provide ongoing accessibility training for developers. |\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Compliance Verification by Strategic Pillar  \n\n#### 1. Smart Factory Architecture  \n* **Data Protection:** All predictive‑maintenance sensors capture only necessary data; anonymisation applied where feasible.  \n* **Security:** Architecture uses IEC 62443‑1‑1 zones, network segmentation, and secure OTA updates.  \n* **Social Value:** Design promotes local job creation (maintenance technicians) and energy‑efficient operations (lower carbon).  \n\n#### 2. Data Integration Strategy  \n* **GDPR:** Data‑flow diagrams show lawful basis (performance of contract, legitimate interest).  \n* **Data Security Act:** Uses role‑based access control (RBAC) and multi‑factor authentication (MFA) for ERP/MES access.  \n* **Accessibility:** Data dashboards are WCAG 2.1 AA compliant; real‑time alerts delivered via accessible mobile app.  \n\n#### 3. Cybersecurity Framework  \n* **IEC 62443:** Incorporates device‑level hardening, secure boot, and intrusion detection.  \n* **ISO 27001:** Covers asset classification, risk treatment, and continuous monitoring.  \n* **Incident Response:** Defined playbooks for cyber‑physical incidents, including containment, eradication, and lessons‑learned.  \n\n#### 4. Supply‑Chain Optimisation  \n* **Social Value:** Supplier risk assessment includes ESG criteria; contracts require local sourcing where possible.  \n* **Data Protection:** Supplier data processed under data‑processing agreements (DPAs) compliant with GDPR.  \n* **Accessibility:** Supplier portals are accessible and multilingual to support global partners.  \n\n#### 5. Workforce Transformation  \n* **GDPR:** Employee data handled under lawful bases (contractual necessity, legitimate interest).  \n* **Equality:** Reskilling programmes target under‑represented groups; training delivery is accessible.  \n* **OHS:** Human‑robot collaboration designs adhere to ISO 45001 safety standards.  \n\n---\n\n### Implementation & Compliance Timeline  \n\n| Phase | Duration |

# Comprehensive Data Quality Management System  
*(≈ 3,200 words)*  

---

## Executive Summary  

Data quality is the cornerstone of reliable analytics, regulatory compliance, and business agility. In a Digital‑Twin environment—where real‑time sensor streams, edge processing, cloud storage, and advanced analytics converge—poor data quality can cascade into incorrect model outputs, regulatory penalties, and lost customer trust.  

This Data Quality Management System (DQMS) delivers a full‑stack, end‑to‑end framework that:  

1. **Aligns** with the organization’s strategic objectives and the regulatory landscape (GDPR, CCPA, SOX, HIPAA, FERPA, ISO 27001, NIST SP 800‑53, DCAM/DAMA‑DMBOK).  
2. **Defines** clear data quality dimensions, metrics, thresholds, and measurement procedures.  
3. **Implements** automated profiling, monitoring, alerting, and remediation.  
4. **Governes** data quality through roles, policies, and continuous improvement.  
5. **Empowers** business users with self‑service tools, training, and dashboards.  

The DQMS is structured into ten core components: Strategy, Dimensions, Metrics, Profiling, Monitoring, Cleansing, Governance, Tools, Reporting, and Training. A phased implementation roadmap, resource plan, and KPI framework are also provided.
