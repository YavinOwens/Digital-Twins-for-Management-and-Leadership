<b> Abstract </b>
<i> Journal of Industrial Information Integration </i>

Recent events worldwide of climate and geological origins highlight the vulnerability of our infrastructures and stress the often dramatic consequences on our environment. Accurate digital models are needed to understand how climate change and associated risks affect buildings, while informing on ways of enhancing their adaptability and resilience. This requires a paradigm shift in design and engineering interventions as the potential for adaptation and resilience should be embedded into initial brief formulation, design, engineering, construction and facility maintenance methods. This paper argues the need for smarter and digital interventions for buildings and infrastructures and their underpinning data systems that factor in topology (including geometry), mereology, and behavioural (dynamic) considerations. Digital models can be used as a basis to understand the complex interplay between environmental variables and performance, and explore real-time response strategies (including control and actuation) to known and uncertain solicitations enabled by a new generation of technologies.

The paper proposes a digital twin model for the construction and industrial assets that paves the way to
a new generation of buildings and infrastructures that;

1. Address lifetime requirements.
2. Capable of performing optimally within the constraints of unknown future scenarios. 
3. Achieve acceptable levels of adaptability, efficiency and resilience.

<b> What Is a Digital Twin in Management? </b>

A digital twin is a virtual replica of a physical system, process, or organization, designed to simulate, monitor, and control real-world entities in real time. In management, this translates to mirroring business processes, leadership actions, and organizational resources in a dynamic, data-driven model. These twins use layers of technology—from data ingestion through analytics to visual interaction—enabling predictive modeling, scenario planning, and optimized decision-making.

<b> How Digital Twins Support Leadership </b>

Digital twins allow leaders and managers to:

Run 'what-if' scenario analyses, testing strategies before real-world execution.
Gain 360-degree, real-time visibility into operations and human resources.
Embed AI, optimization algorithms, and advanced analytics to simulate and automate leadership decision points (e.g., resource allocation, risk mitigation).
Foster organizational agility and resilience through continuous monitoring, feedback loops, and rapid adjustment.
Enhance communication and coordination across virtual teams and remote workforces, improving the organizational leadership model.

<b> Key Layers in Management Digital Twin Architectures </b>
Digital twins for management and leadership typically leverage a five-layered technology stack:

- Physical layer: Sensors and real-world data sources
- Data processing layer: Aggregation and transformation
- Data storage layer: Centralized or distributed data warehouses/lakes
- Analytics and computation layer: Predictive, prescriptive, and descriptive analytics
- Visualization and interaction layer: Dashboards, real-time feedback, and simulation environments.

<b> Strategic Management and Leadership Implications </b>

Digital twins can be used to model leadership teams, management structures, and corporate behaviors, automating tasks and interactions in virtual environments.

They support continuous organisational improvement, helping executives iterate strategies, monitor KPIs, and proactively adapt to changes.

Digital twins act as a “managerial revolution,” serving as real-time advisors, simulating potential team dynamics or market responses, and supporting culture and change management initiatives,

In complex or crisis situations, digital twins can provide leaders with faster, data-driven decision tools, enabling superior resource optimization and scenario planning compared to traditional approaches.

<b> Practical Examples </b>

- Modeling and optimizing entire business units, from supply chains to human resource allocations.
- Simulating leadership responses to hypothetical disruptions or organizational transformations.
- Enabling autonomous management agents or ‘leader avatars’ that take routine decisions or coordinate digital assets based on real-time data.

<b> Critical Success Factors </b>

Successful implementation requires robust big data infrastructure, clear organizational architecture, and investments in IoT, AI, and analytics platforms.

Leadership buy-in is essential, as is ongoing data governance and ethical oversight to avoid “algorithmic blindness” or bias in decisions.
