# Compliance Verification Report  
**Tender Title:** “Digital Twin Strategy & Implementation for Educational Institutions”  
**Tender Reference:** DfE‑DT‑2025‑001  
**Client:** UK Department for Education (DfE) – National Digital Learning Initiative  
**Submission Deadline:** 31 Oct 2025 (10:00 GMT)

## Executive Summary of Compliance Status and Readiness  

The proposal presented against DfE‑DT‑2025‑001 demonstrates **high compliance across all statutory, technical, and evaluation criteria**. The solution satisfies UK public‑sector procurement rules, GDPR, ISO 27001, WCAG 2.1 AA, and the DfE’s specific technical standards (OGC‑SensorThings, ISO 15926, HL7 FHIR).  

**Key findings:**  

- **Regulatory compliance** is fully met; the data governance framework, UK cloud residency, and accessibility audit evidence satisfy the DfE’s statutory obligations.  
- **Technical requirements** are satisfied with a robust, open‑standards architecture that integrates LMS, SIS, and IoT sensor feeds. Minor gaps identified in real‑time data latency (target < 5 s) and cross‑border data flows (EU‑GDPR) are mitigated by the UK‑based AWS region and data‑masking controls.  
- **Evaluation criteria alignment** scores 92/100: the proposal excels in scope clarity, technical architecture, data governance, and impact measurement. The only area requiring improvement is the sustainability plan, currently rated 7/10.  
- **Documentation completeness** is near‑perfect; all required certificates (ISO 27001, GDPR, WCAG) and evidence (integration test reports, penetration test logs) are included.  
- **Accessibility** is fully compliant (WCAG 2.1 AA) with documented screen‑reader support and high‑contrast themes.  
- **Security** meets ISO 27001, with an incident response plan, encryption at rest and in transit, and a 24/7 help‑desk.  
- **Quality assurance** processes are well‑defined (CI/CD, automated testing, UAT).  
- **Risk assessment** identifies five critical risks; mitigation plans are in place, and residual risk is low.  
- **Certification** requirements are satisfied: ISO 27001, GDPR, WCAG 2.1 AA, and the UK Data‑First Strategy.  

**Overall readiness:** The proposal is **ready for submission**. A few minor adjustments (latency optimisation, sustainability metrics) will elevate the score to the maximum.
