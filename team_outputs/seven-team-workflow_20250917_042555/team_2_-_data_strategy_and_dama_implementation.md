## 1. Executive Summary  

Digital twins create a continuous, data‑driven loop that transforms learning, operations, and strategy. Implementing them at scale requires a disciplined, phased approach that marries **DCAM** (Data Capability Assessment Model) maturity with robust data‑governance practices.  

The roadmap below delivers:  

1. **Phased implementation** – five tranches that evolve from governance to optimization.  
2. **Clear milestones** – each tranche has measurable deliverables.  
3. **Integrated timeline** – dependencies and critical path are mapped.  
4. **Risk & mitigation** – proactive controls for technical, regulatory, and organizational risks.  
5. **Stakeholder & change‑management plan** – ensures adoption, skill development, and continuous improvement.
