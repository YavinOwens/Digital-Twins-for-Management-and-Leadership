## 2. Detailed Regulatory Compliance Assessment (≈400 words)

| Requirement | Evidence | Gap Analysis | Mitigation |
|-------------|----------|--------------|------------|
| **UK Public Sector Procurement** (PPR 2015) | Tender submission follows the e‑Procurement guidelines, e‑signature, and electronic submission. | None | – |
| **GDPR & UK Data Protection Act 2018** | DPIA completed (Annexure C), data anonymisation layer, role‑based access, data retention policy. | Minor: Data retention schedule not fully mapped to each data type. | Update Annexure C with detailed retention matrix. |
| **EAL 5+ Common Criteria** | Security architecture document, penetration testing reports, ISO 27001 controls. | None | – |
| **ISO 27001:2022** | Certification valid, risk assessment, incident response plan. | None | – |
| **ISO 9001:2015** | Process documentation, continuous improvement logs. | None | – |
