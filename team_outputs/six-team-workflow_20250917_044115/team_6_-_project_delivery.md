# Project Management Specification for the Digital Twin Implementation in Education  
*(Approx. 3,800 words)*  

---

## Executive Summary  

The Digital Twin for Education initiative is a strategic, enterprise‑wide effort to create a real‑time, data‑rich virtual replica of the entire learning ecosystem. The twin will ingest telemetry from IoT sensors, learning management systems (LMS), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and external demographic feeds, cleanse and enrich the data, and expose it through secure APIs, dashboards, and analytics services.  

The goal of this specification is to provide a **complete, actionable project management framework** that ensures the initiative is delivered on time, within budget, and to the highest quality standards. It is built around **Agile** principles, with clearly defined governance, risk, quality, communication, change, budget, stakeholder, and documentation processes.
