**Key Dependencies**

| Dependency | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| **EDM completion** → Enables pipeline design and data quality rule creation. |
| **Data Inventory** → Required for source‑to‑target mapping. |
| **Quality Engine** → Must be operational before encryption & RBAC to ensure clean data. |
| **Data Lake** → Foundation for simulation model and analytics. |
| **Monitoring** → Needed before lifecycle policies to capture real‑time metrics. |
| **Federated Learning** → Requires mature twin engine and data quality baseline. |

## 4. Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| **Data Silos** | High | High | • Enforce source‑to‑target mapping<br>• Implement data catalog | Data Architect |
| **Poor Data Quality** | Medium | High | • Deploy rule engine early<br>• Continuous data profiling | Data Quality Lead |
| **Security Breach** | Low | Critical | • Encrypt all data<br>• RBAC & MFA<br>• Regular penetration testing | Security Lead |
| **Stakeholder Resistance** | Medium | Medium | • Early engagement workshops<br>• User training & support | Change Manager |
| **Integration Failures** | Medium | High | • Incremental integration testing<br>• Use API gateways | Integration Lead |
| **Regulatory Non‑Compliance** | Low | Critical | • Conduct PIAs<br>• Maintain audit trail | Compliance Officer |
| **Scope Creep** | High | Medium | • Formal change control process<br>• Prioritise backlog | Project Manager |
| **Resource Constraints** | Medium | Medium | • Cross‑functional staffing<br>• Agile sprint reviews | PMO |
| **Model Drift** | Low | Medium | • Continuous model monitoring<br>• Retraining schedule | Data Scientist |

**Risk Register Maintenance**

- Updated monthly in the PMO dashboard.  
- Risk owners review mitigation status in sprint retrospectives.  
- Escalation triggers: any risk rated **High** impact and **High** likelihood moves to **Critical** status and is addressed in the next sprint.

## 5. Stakeholder Engagement & Change Management Plan

|--------------------|------|-----------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Executive Steering Committee** | Decision‑makers | Quarterly vision reviews, KPI sign‑off | Quarterly | Charter signed; KPI approvals |
| **Data Governance Council** | Governance | Monthly governance meetings, policy reviews | Monthly | Policies updated & approved |
| **IT Operations** | Infrastructure | Bi‑weekly ops sync, incident drills | Bi‑weekly | MTTR ≤ 4 hrs |
| **Data Engineers / Scientists** | Build & model | Sprint demos, knowledge sharing | Sprint (2 weeks) | Models deployed on schedule |
| **Business Users (e.g., Academic Leaders)** | End‑users | Training workshops, user testing | Monthly | Adoption ≥ 80 % |
| **Students / Learners** | Primary beneficiaries | Feedback surveys, focus groups | Quarterly | Satisfaction ≥ 4/5 |
| **Legal & Compliance** | Risk oversight | PIAs, audit readiness | As needed | Compliance audit passed |
| **External Partners (e.g., LMS vendors)** | Integration partners | Integration workshops, API testing | As needed | Successful data exchange |

### Change Management Tactics

1. **Communication Plan** – Clear messaging on benefits, timelines, and user impact.  
2. **Training & Enablement** – Role‑based training modules, certification tracks.  
3. **Champion Network** – Identify and empower internal champions per department.  
4. **Feedback Loops** – Continuous user surveys, suggestion portal.  
5. **Recognition & Incentives** – Acknowledge early adopters and high‑impact contributors.  

### Change Readiness Assessment

- **Pre‑Launch Survey** – Measure baseline readiness (knowledge, attitude, confidence).  
- **Readiness Score** – ≥ 70 % indicates readiness; below triggers additional training.  
- **Post‑Launch Review** – Compare adoption rates and adjust support accordingly.
