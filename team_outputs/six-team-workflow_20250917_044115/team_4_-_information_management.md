## 1. Executive Summary (≈ 300 words)

The organization’s digital transformation—cloud migration, analytics, and the Digital Twin initiative—creates unprecedented value but also exposes the enterprise to a complex matrix of regulatory, security, and operational risks. A robust Data Quality Management System (DQMS) is essential to ensure that every data asset is accurate, complete, consistent, timely, valid, and unique, thereby enabling reliable analytics, sound decision‑making, and regulatory compliance.

**Key Objectives**

1. **Align Data Quality with Business Strategy** – Tie quality initiatives to digital twin KPIs, revenue targets, and risk mitigations.  
2. **Establish a Unified Quality Framework** – Define dimensions, metrics, thresholds, and measurement procedures that are consistent across domains and regulatory regimes.  
3. **Automate Monitoring & Alerting** – Deploy continuous, real‑time quality checks that trigger remediation workflows and executive alerts.  
4. **Implement Systematic Cleansing & Remediation** – Adopt data profiling, rule‑based transformations, and AI‑driven correction pipelines.  
5. **Govern Quality Through Policies & Roles** – Embed quality responsibilities into the data governance charter, with clear ownership, stewardship, and accountability.  
6. **Leverage Proven Tools & Standards** – Adopt industry‑standard platforms (e.g., Great Expectations, Informatica Data Quality, Collibra, Snowflake, AWS Glue) and align with ISO 27001, NIST SP 800‑53, GDPR, CCPA, SOX, HIPAA, FERPA, PCI‑DSS, BCRs, and SCCs.  
7. **Measure Success** – Define and track KPIs such as Data Quality Index, MTTR for quality incidents, compliance score, and stakeholder NPS.

By embedding these pillars into the enterprise data architecture, the organization will mitigate fines, protect stakeholder trust, and unlock the full value of its data assets while fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

2. **Master Taxonomy** – Build a unified taxonomy that merges enterprise data model, business glossary, and regulatory categories.  
3. **Quality Rules Engine** – Adopt a rule‑based engine (Great Expectations, Informatica Data Quality) to encode accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and uniqueness rules.  
4. **Continuous Monitoring** – Orchestrate nightly or real‑time quality jobs via Airflow or Prefect; push alerts to Slack/Teams and ticketing systems.  
5. **Remediation Pipelines** – Automate cleansing (e.g., standardization, deduplication) and route exceptions to data stewards for manual review.  
6. **Governance Integration** – Embed quality metrics into the Data Governance Council’s KPI review and into the Data Quality Dashboard.  
7. **Compliance Alignment** – Map each quality rule to a regulatory requirement; maintain an evidence repository for audits.
