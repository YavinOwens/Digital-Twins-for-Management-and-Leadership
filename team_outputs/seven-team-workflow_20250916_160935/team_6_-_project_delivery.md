# Smart‑City Digital‑Twin Project Management Specification  
*(≈ 3 800 words)*  

---

## 1. Executive Summary  

The “Benefits of Smart Cities” initiative is a city‑wide, data‑driven transformation that leverages a cloud‑native digital twin to quantify and accelerate the value delivered by connected urban services.  The platform ingests heterogeneous telemetry—traffic cameras, environmental sensors, public‑transport APIs, IoT devices, and citizen feeds—into a unified, continuously evolving model that powers real‑time dashboards, predictive analytics, and self‑optimizing city operations.  

This specification defines a **complete project‑management framework** that delivers the platform on time, within budget, and with the high quality, security, and governance required of a public‑sector data‑product.  The framework is built on **Agile** principles, emphasizes **cross‑functional collaboration**, and uses a modern toolchain (Azure, Databricks, Synapse, API Management, Purview, Bicep, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, Istio, Azure Monitor, Sentinel, and Azure ML).  

Key outcomes:  

| Outcome | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Scalability** | Horizontal scaling of Event Hub partitions, Databricks clusters, Synapse DW units, and API‑gateway instances to support millions of events per second and thousands of concurrent users. |
| **Reliability** | 99.99 % uptime via managed services, auto‑failover, immutable Delta Lake, and DR to a secondary region. |
| **Performance** | < 1 s ingestion, < 5 ms inference, 1–5 s Synapse queries; AQE, caching, and materialized views keep analytics fast. |
| **Security & Compliance** | Multi‑layer defense (IAM, RBAC, network, encryption), GDPR/CCPA alignment, Azure Sentinel SIEM, Purview governance. |
| **Observability** | Azure Monitor + Sentinel, Prometheus/Grafana, automated remediation, full lineage. |
| **Maintainability** | IaC (Bicep/Terraform), GitOps, CI/CD, automated tests, runbooks, and a living knowledge base. |

## 2. Project Governance  

| Governance Element | Description | Owner / Authority |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Steering Committee** | Senior city executives, finance, legal, IT, and citizen‑services leads. | Chair: Chief Digital Officer |
| **Product Owner** | Defines backlog, prioritises features, validates deliverables. | City Data Science Lead |
| **Scrum Master** | Removes impediments, enforces Agile ceremonies, ensures velocity. | Agile PM (external) |
| **Architecture Review Board** | Validates technical design, security, and compliance. | Lead Solution Architect |
| **Change Control Board (CCB)** | Approves scope changes, versioning, configuration changes. | IT PMO |
| **Risk Management Committee** | Identifies, assesses, and mitigates risks. | Risk Officer |
| **Quality Assurance Lead** | Ensures testing coverage, quality gates, and regression prevention. | QA Manager |

**Decision‑Making Process**  
1. **Sprint Planning** – Product Owner presents backlog items; teams commit.  
2. **Daily Scrum** – 15‑minute stand‑up to surface blockers.  
3. **Sprint Review** – Demo to stakeholders, gather feedback.  
4. **Sprint Retrospective** – Continuous improvement.  
5. **Governance Escalation** – Any change > 10 % of scope or budget escalates to Steering Committee.  
6. **Risk Review** – Weekly risk board meeting; high‑severity risks trigger immediate action.  

All decisions are captured in **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** and stored in the project knowledge base.

### Closing Remarks  

This document is a living artifact.  Each section is linked to the corresponding artifact in the project repository or Confluence.  All stakeholders are invited to review, provide feedback, and sign off through the CCB.  The next step is to transition from Sprint 0 (kick‑off) to Sprint 1 (IaC & environment) and begin the first production‑ready build.
