## Final Answer

# 1. Executive Summary  

Data is the lifeblood of the City’s Digital‑Twin (DT) initiative.  While the DT’s technical architecture brings together real‑time sensor feeds, citizen services, and analytics, it also creates a complex data ecosystem that must meet stringent regulatory, operational, and strategic requirements.  This Data Quality Management System (DQMS) is designed to embed data quality into every layer of the DT, from ingestion to consumption, and to align tightly with the existing compliance and risk framework (ISO 31000, NIST CSF, ISO 27001, GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOX, etc.).  

**Key outcomes of the DQMS:**

| Outcome | Target | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Data Quality Index (DQI) ≥ 90 % | 90 % | In progress |
| 100 % catalog coverage | 100 % | In progress |
| Regulatory compliance score ≥ 95 % | 95 % | In progress |
| Automated monitoring alerts | 100 % | In progress |
| Data cleansing cycle time ≤ 30 days | 30 days | In progress |
| Governance council operating | 1st meeting completed | Completed |

The DQMS is built around **six pillars**: strategy, metrics, profiling, monitoring, cleansing, and governance.  Each pillar contains specific procedures, tools, and success metrics that feed into a continuous improvement loop.  The framework is fully scalable, auditable, and designed to support the City’s strategic objectives while mitigating regulatory exposure and operational risk.

# 2. Data Quality Strategy  

## 2.1 Vision & Mission  

- **Vision:** To transform raw data into a trusted, high‑value asset that powers evidence‑based city planning, enhances citizen services, and safeguards public trust.  
- **Mission:** Establish a holistic, automated data quality ecosystem that guarantees accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and uniqueness across all DT data assets.

## 2.2 Scope  

- **Data Domains:** Transportation, Utilities, Health, Education, Public Safety, Finance, Human Resources, and Citizen Services.  
- **Data Types:** Structured (databases, data warehouses), semi‑structured (JSON, XML), unstructured (PDF, images), and streaming (IoT sensors).  
- **Lifecycle Stages:** Ingestion, storage, processing, analytics, archiving, and disposal.

## 2.3 Success Metrics  

| Metric | Target | Frequency |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **DQI** | ≥ 90 % | Daily |
| **Catalog Coverage** | 100 % | Quarterly |
| **Regulatory Compliance Score** | ≥ 95 % | Quarterly |
| **Mean Time to Remediation** | ≤ 30 days | Monthly |
| **Incident Response Time** | ≤ 15 min | Real‑time |
| **Data Stewardship Compliance** | 100 % | Quarterly |

# 3. Data Quality Dimensions  

| Dimension | Definition | Why It Matters | Typical Indicators |
|-----------|------------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Accuracy** | Correctness of data values relative to the real world | Enables reliable decisions | % of records matching reference data |
| **Completeness** | Presence of all required data elements | Prevents analysis gaps | % of mandatory fields populated |
| **Consistency** | Uniformity across systems and time | Avoids contradictory insights | Duplicate records, conflicting values |
| **Timeliness** | Freshness of data relative to business need | Supports real‑time operations | Age of last update |
| **Validity** | Conformance to business rules and formats | Ensures data integrity | % of values passing validation |
| **Uniqueness** | Absence of duplicate records | Reduces storage waste and logical errors | Duplicate detection rate |

These dimensions map directly to regulatory requirements: e.g., *completeness* and *validity* support GDPR “data minimization”, while *accuracy* and *uniqueness* are essential for SOX “materiality” controls.

---

# 4. Data Quality Metrics Framework  

### 4.1 Composite Data Quality Index (DQI)

**Formula:**  
`DQI = w1*Accuracy + w2*Completeness + w3*Consistency + w4*Timeliness + w5*Validity + w6*Uniqueness`  
Weights (w1‑w6) are set by the Data Governance Council (e.g., Accuracy 30 %, Completeness 25 %, Consistency 15 %, Timeliness 10 %, Validity 10 %, Uniqueness 10 %).

**Target:** ≥ 90 % across all domains.

### 4.2 Dimension‑Specific Thresholds  

| Dimension | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Accuracy** | ≥ 99 % | No action |
| **Completeness** | ≥ 98 % | Flag for remediation |
| **Consistency** | ≥ 97 % | Flag for review |
| **Timeliness** | ≤ 4 hrs (real‑time) | No action |
| **Validity** | ≥ 99 % | No action |
| **Uniqueness** | ≤ 0.1 % duplicates | Flag for deduplication |

### 4.3 Measurement Procedures  

1. **Sampling**: 5 % stratified random sample per domain per day.  
2. **Automated Checks**: SQL scripts or data quality engines run against the sample.  
3. **Audit Trail**: Results logged in the Data Quality Dashboard.  
4. **Escalation**: Threshold breaches trigger alerts to the Data Steward and the Data Quality Lead.

# 5. Data Profiling and Assessment Procedures  

## 5.1 Profiling Workflow  

| Step | Activity | Tool | Owner | Frequency |
|------|----------|------|-------|-----------|
| **Discover** | Scan data sources for schema, cardinality, and nulls | DataHub, Apache Atlas | Data Engineer | Monthly |
| **Analyze** | Compute statistics (min/max, mean, mode, distinct count) | Great Expectations | Data Quality Lead | Weekly |
| **Validate** | Apply business rules (e.g., postal code format, unique IDs) | Python scripts, Spark | Data Steward | Weekly |
| **Document** | Store profiling reports in the catalog | Confluence, Data Catalog | Documentation Lead | Monthly |
| **Review** | Data Steward reviews findings, determines remediation scope | Meeting | Data Steward | Monthly |

## 5.2 Profiling Metrics  

- **Null Ratio**: % of nulls per column.  
- **Duplicate Ratio**: % duplicates per key fields.  
- **Range Violation**: % values outside expected bounds.  
- **Pattern Violations**: % of values not matching regex.

These metrics feed into the DQI calculation and trigger the automated monitoring system.

# 6. Data Quality Monitoring & Alerting Systems  

## 6.1 Architecture  

```
+-----------------+          +-----------------+          +-----------------+
|  Data Sources   |  -->    |  Data Quality   |  -->    |  Monitoring &   |
|  (DB, Stream,   |  -->    |  Engine (DQS)   |  -->    |  Alerting       |
|  Files)         |          |  (Great Expectations,  |  (PagerDuty,   |
|                 |          |   Spark)         |          |  Slack, Email) |
+-----------------+          +-----------------+          +-----------------+
```

## 6.2 Monitoring Cadence  

| Metric | Frequency | Alert Threshold | Escalation |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **DQI** | Daily | < 90 % | Data Steward → Data Quality Lead → MGC |
| **Null Ratio** | Daily | > 5 % | Data Steward → Data Engineer |
| **Duplicate Ratio** | Daily | > 1 % | Data Steward → Data Engineer |
| **Pattern Violation** | Daily | > 2 % | Data Steward → Data Engineer |
| **Latency** | Real‑time | > 4 hrs | Ops Lead → Incident Response |

## 6.3 Alerting Mechanism  

- **Primary Channel**: PagerDuty incident for critical alerts (DQI < 90 %).  
- **Secondary Channel**: Slack channel “#dq-alerts” for all alerts.  
- **Reporting**: All alerts are logged in the Data Quality Dashboard and automatically entered into the Jira ticketing system with a unique incident ID.

# 7. Data Cleansing & Remediation Procedures  

## 7.1 Cleansing Strategy  

| Cleansing Type | Description | Tool | Owner | Frequency |
|----------------|-------------|------|-------|-----------|

4. **Execution** – Run cleansing job in a staging environment.  
5. **Validation** – Re‑profile impacted data to confirm DQI improvement.  
6. **Approval** – Data Governance Council signs off before moving to production.  
7. **Documentation** – Update catalog record and change log.

## 7.3 Success Metrics  

- **Remediation Cycle Time** ≤ 30 days (average).  
- **Post‑Remediation DQI Improvement** ≥ 5 %.  
- **Defect Recurrence Rate** ≤ 2 % within 90 days.
