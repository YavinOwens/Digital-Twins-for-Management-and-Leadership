# Executive Summary  

Digital twins—real‑time, data‑driven replicas of physical or business processes—unlock predictive insight, scenario testing, and operational efficiency. By anchoring the twin to a rigorous audit and governance framework that blends SOX, ISO 8000, and the DCAM (Data‑Centric Analytics & Modeling) model, the organization can ensure data quality, risk compliance, and stakeholder confidence while delivering measurable business value.  

**Outcome:** A phased, auditable, and continuously monitored digital‑twin ecosystem that is fully governed, risk‑aware, and aligned with enterprise strategy, ready for deployment within 18 months.
