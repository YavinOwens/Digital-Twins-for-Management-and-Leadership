## 1. Executive Overview  
The digital transformation roadmap for a mid‑size regional bank (200 branches, 1.2 m customers) must simultaneously deliver high‑value analytics, AI‑powered insights, and automated risk controls while **meeting every relevant UK and EU regulatory requirement**. The following compliance verification framework validates that the proposed initiatives (Customer Data Strategy, Regulatory Compliance, Technology Stack, Risk Management Framework, Competitive Positioning) will be fully compliant with:

| Regulatory Domain | Key Regs/Standards | Compliance Focus |
|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Data Protection | UK GDPR, Data Protection Act 2018, GDPR‑UK | Lawful basis, DPIA, Data Subject Rights, PIA |
| Banking Risk | Basel III, FCA Prudential Sourcebook (PRU), PRA requirements | Capital adequacy, liquidity, market risk, operational risk |
| Payment & Card | PSD2, Open Banking, PCI DSS | Strong Customer Authentication, data security |
| Corporate Governance | Sarbanes‑Oxley (SOX) UK adaptation, FCA Conduct Rules | Internal controls, audit trails |
| AI/ML | UK AI Strategy, EU AI Act (where applicable), FCA guidance | Transparency, explainability, bias mitigation |
| Accessibility | Equality Act 2010, WCAG 2.1 AA | Digital service design |
| Cybersecurity | NCSC, Cyber Essentials, ISO/IEC 27001 | Threat detection, incident response |

The framework below maps each transformation pillar to the relevant regulatory controls, providing a **check‑list of verifiable compliance actions** that bank executives and technology leaders can use to audit progress.

### Next Steps for Executives & Technology Leadership  

1. **Approve the compliance verification checklist and integrate it into the project governance framework.**  
2. **Allocate resources for DPIA, PIA, and Model Governance roles.**  
3. **Set up a cross‑functional compliance steering committee (CISO, CRO, COO, CTO, Legal).**  
4. **Kick‑off the 12‑month implementation roadmap with clear milestone reviews and audit checkpoints.**  

By following this compliance‑centric transformation plan, the bank will deliver a scalable, AI‑enabled digital platform that not only meets every regulatory obligation but also positions it competitively against fintech disruptors and digital‑first banks.
