# Executive Summary  

Digital twins—real‑time, data‑driven replicas of physical or business processes—unlock predictive insight, scenario testing, and operational efficiency. By anchoring the twin to a rigorous audit and governance framework that blends SOX, ISO 8000, and the DCAM (Data‑Centric Analytics & Modeling) model, the organization can ensure data quality, risk compliance, and stakeholder confidence while delivering measurable business value.  

**Outcome:** A phased, auditable, and continuously monitored digital‑twin ecosystem that is fully governed, risk‑aware, and aligned with enterprise strategy, ready for deployment within 18 months.

# 5. Audit Program  

| Audit Focus | Audit Objective | Key Controls | Frequency | Owner |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Data Quality & Lineage** | Verify accuracy, completeness, and traceability of twin data | Data profiling rules, lineage mapping, data quality scorecards | Quarterly | Data Governance Office |
| **Model Risk & Validation** | Ensure models meet performance, stability, and regulatory standards | Validation frameworks, out‑of‑sample testing, drift detection | Semi‑annual | MRMC |
| **Security & Privacy** | Protect data confidentiality, integrity, and compliance with GDPR/CCPA | Access controls, encryption, privacy impact assessments | Quarterly | IT Security |
