# Digital Transformation & Compliance Blueprint for a Mid‑Size Regional Bank  
*(Designed for senior executives and technology leadership – aligned with UK and EU regulatory frameworks, Crown Commercial Service best‑practice procurement standards, and data‑centric competitive strategy.)*  

---  

## Executive Summary  
- **Objective:** Deliver a 360‑degree customer view, real‑time fraud detection, and AI‑driven risk analytics while maintaining full alignment with Basel III, PCI DSS, SOX, GDPR, PSD2, FCA, and local UK financial regulations.  
- **Outcome:** A cloud‑native, data‑lake‑first architecture that powers scalable, regulated AI/ML services, enabling the bank to compete with fintech disruptors through superior, personalised customer experiences and robust risk resilience.  
- **Road‑Map:** 3‑phase 18‑month implementation (design, build, optimise) with built‑in audit trails, certification checkpoints, and continuous compliance monitoring.

## 1. Customer Data Strategy  
| Element | Action | Compliance Driver | KPI | Milestone |
|---------|--------|-------------------|-----|-----------|
| **Unified Data Lake** | Deploy a single, GDPR‑compliant data lake (e.g., Snowflake on AWS/GCP) ingesting banking, investment, and insurance streams via secure CDC pipelines. | GDPR, FCA “Data Management” guidance | Data latency <5 min | Phase 1 (Month 3) |
| **Master Data Management (MDM)** | Implement an MDM hub (e.g., Informatica MDM) to create a 360° customer profile (accounts, assets, policies, interactions). | GDPR, FCA “Customer Data Management” | Profile completeness 95 % | Phase 2 (Month 9) |
| **Consent & Rights Management** | Integrate a consent engine (e.g., OneTrust) with automated opt‑in/opt‑out flows, linking to the data lake. | GDPR, UK Data Protection Act | 100 % consent audit compliance | Phase 1 (Month 3) |
| **Data Quality & Governance** | Enforce data quality rules (deduplication, validation) via Talend or Datafold; establish a Data Governance Council. | GDPR, FCA “Data Governance” | Data quality score ≥ 99 % | Phase 2 (Month 9) |
| **Personalised AI Insights** | Build AI‑driven recommendation engines (collaborative filtering, NLP) that use the unified profile for cross‑sell and upsell. | GDPR, FCA “Consumer Protection” | Increase cross‑sell rate 15 % | Phase 3 (Month 15) |

**Implementation Plan**  
1. **Design** – Architecture workshops; data inventory; compliance gap analysis.  
2. **Build** – Deploy data lake, MDM, consent engine, governance framework.  
3. **Validate** – Data quality tests, GDPR impact assessments, FCA data‑protection review.  
4. **Go‑Live** – Phased rollout to branches; continuous monitoring via DataOps pipeline.
