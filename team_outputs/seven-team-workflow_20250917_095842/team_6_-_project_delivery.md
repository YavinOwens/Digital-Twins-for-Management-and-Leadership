## 1. Executive Summary  
A mid‑size regional bank (200 branches, 1.2 M customers) can unlock $500 M‑$1 B in value by orchestrating a unified, data‑centric digital transformation. The framework below delivers a 360° customer view, real‑time risk intelligence, and a competitive moat against fintech disruptors. It is scaffolded on a cloud‑native, AI‑driven architecture that satisfies Basel III, PCI DSS, SOX, and local regulations while enabling automated fraud detection and precision risk scoring.
