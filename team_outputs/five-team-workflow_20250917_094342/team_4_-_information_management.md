**Thought:** I now can give a great answer  

**Final Answer**  

Below is a **complete, phased data‑quality management framework** designed for a global enterprise that must ensure data accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability across all information systems. The framework blends proven industry standards (ISO 8000, DCAM, OCEG GRC, COBIT) and best‑practice governance structures to deliver continuous compliance, risk mitigation, and perpetual improvement.

## 5. Data Quality Management Processes

### 5.1 Data Profiling

| Dimension | Key Metrics | Tooling |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Completeness** | % of nulls, missing values | Talend, Informatica, OpenRefine |
| **Accuracy** | % matches against reference source, error rate | DataCleaner, Apache Griffin |
| **Uniqueness** | Duplicate key rate | SQL dedupe scripts, Data Quality Services |
| **Validity** | Schema conformance, regex checks | Great Expectations, Dataedo |
| **Consistency** | Cross‑table referential integrity | SQL validation, Data Quality Hub |
| **Timeliness** | Age of data, lag in ETL | DataOps pipelines, Airflow DAGs |

### 5.2 Data Cleansing & Enrichment

| Activity | Description | Responsible |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Record Standardization** | Normalizing addresses, names, units | Domain Stewards |
| **Master Data Creation** | Deduplication, canonical IDs | MDM team |
| **Data Enrichment** | Adding missing attributes (e.g., ZIP‑code lookup) | Data Scientists |
