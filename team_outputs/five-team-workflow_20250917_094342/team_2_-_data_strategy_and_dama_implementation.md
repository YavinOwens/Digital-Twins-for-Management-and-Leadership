**Thought:** I now can give a great answer  

**Final Answer**

Below is a **complete, phased implementation roadmap** for deploying a digital‑twin ecosystem across a global automotive‑components and industrial‑machinery manufacturer (50 plants, 15 countries). The plan is built on the **Data Governance** and **DCAM (Data Management Architecture & Maturity)** frameworks, ensuring that data quality, lineage, security, and stewardship are embedded from day‑one. It is organized into **four delivery tranches** (Foundations, Pilot, Scale, and Optimization) with a realistic 3‑year timeline, risk‑management, stakeholder‑engagement, and KPI set‑up that guarantees executive endorsement and operational buy‑in.
