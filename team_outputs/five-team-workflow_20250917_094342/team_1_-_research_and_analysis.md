## 3. Key Findings & Analysis  

| Pillar | Findings | Implications |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Smart Factory Architecture** | • Existing sensor coverage < 30 % of critical assets.<br>• Manual QC consumes 25 % of operator time. | Need widespread IoT deployment + AI‑based QC to unlock productivity. |
| **Data Integration** | • ERP, MES, SCADA data siloed; 24‑hour data latency. | Unified data lake essential for real‑time analytics & decision‑making. |
| **Cybersecurity** | • No formal IEC 62443 compliance; legacy PLCs vulnerable. | Immediate need for segmentation, secure gateways, and continuous monitoring. |
| **Supply Chain** | • Demand forecasts lag by 4–6 weeks; inventory holding cost 12 % of COGS. | AI forecasting and dynamic inventory models can reduce costs and stockouts. |
| **Workforce** | • 35 % of staff > 45 years; low digital literacy. | Comprehensive reskilling & HRC programs critical to adoption. |
