## 7. Key Take‑aways for the Tender Team  

1. **Document everything** – evidence files must be in the required format (PDF, Excel, diagrams).  
2. **Align scoring criteria** – map your technical solution directly to the tender’s evaluation weightings.  
3. **Show measurable KPIs** – for sustainability, social value, and security.  
4. **Leverage existing frameworks** – reference CCS Smart City templates and LGA guidance to demonstrate best‑practice alignment.  
5. **Plan for audit** – include audit evidence as part of your submission to avoid last‑minute surprises.
