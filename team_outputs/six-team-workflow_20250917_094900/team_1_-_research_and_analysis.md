## Executive Summary  

The rapid urbanization of a 2‑million‑person metropolitan area demands a data‑driven approach to sustainable development and citizen‑centric services. This report outlines a comprehensive smart‑city data strategy that integrates an urban data ecosystem, IoT infrastructure, privacy & ethics framework, sustainability metrics, and citizen engagement tools. The strategy is grounded in a modular, cloud‑native architecture that ensures scalability, resilience, and real‑time responsiveness. Key outcomes include:  

* **Integrated data platform** that unifies traffic, energy, waste, and public‑safety data streams.  
* **Edge‑centric IoT network** leveraging 5G and edge computing for low‑latency operations.  
* **Robust privacy & ethics governance** aligned with GDPR, CCPA, and emerging AI ethics standards.  
* **Carbon‑footprint tracking** with real‑time dashboards and automated reduction workflows.  
* **Citizen‑first digital services** that provide transparent, actionable insights and participatory dashboards.  

Implementation follows a phased roadmap over 36 months, with clear milestones, budget estimates, and governance structures.
