## Executive Summary  

Digital Twin (DT) implementation is a complex, data‑centric transformation that requires a disciplined, phased approach grounded in proven data governance (DCAM) principles. The roadmap below delivers a clear, step‑by‑step plan that aligns DT development with DCAM’s eight key domains, ensuring data quality, security, lineage, and stakeholder buy‑in at every stage. The strategy is broken into **four delivery tranches**—Foundation, Pilot, Scale, and Continuous Improvement—each with defined milestones, risk mitigations, and change‑management activities. By executing this phased plan, the organization will achieve a robust, scalable DT capable of informing real‑time decision making, predictive analytics, and operational optimization while meeting regulatory and privacy requirements.

## 1. Introduction  

Digital Twins provide a virtual, dynamic representation of physical assets, processes, or systems. Their value lies in real‑time insight, scenario simulation, and predictive maintenance. However, DT success hinges on the integrity, governance, and usability of the underlying data. The Digital Data Asset Management (DCAM) framework offers a comprehensive set of data governance practices that, when mapped to DT development, mitigate risk and accelerate ROI.

**Key Objectives**

| Objective | DCAM Alignment | DT Value |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Establish data ownership and stewardship | Data Governance | Reliable, auditable data sources |
| Ensure data quality and lineage | Data Quality & Lineage | Accurate simulations |
| Protect privacy & security | Data Security & Privacy | Regulatory compliance |
| Enable rapid integration & deployment | Data Integration & Architecture | Faster time‑to‑value |
| Foster continuous improvement | Data Operations & Monitoring | Sustainable innovation |

## 2. DCAM‑Driven Digital Twin Architecture  

| DCAM Domain | DT Component | Governance Activity |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Data Strategy** | Vision, scope, KPI definition | Executive steering committee |
| **Data Governance** | Policies, roles, catalog | Data Governance Council |
| **Data Quality** | Profiling, cleansing, validation | Data Quality Team |
| **Data Architecture** | Data lake, lakehouse, model layer | Architecture Working Group |
| **Data Integration** | Ingestion pipelines, APIs | Integration Architecture |
| **Data Security** | Encryption, access controls, audit | Security Operations Center |
| **Data Operations** | Monitoring, alerting, incident | Ops Center |
