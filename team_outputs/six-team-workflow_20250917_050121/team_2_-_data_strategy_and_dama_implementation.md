## 4. Project Timeline & Dependencies (Gantt‑style)

```
Phase 1 (0–3mo)   |--------------------|
Phase 2 (3–6mo)          |--------------------|
Phase 3 (6–9mo)                     |--------------------|
Phase 4 (9–12mo)                              |--------------------|
Phase 5 (12–18mo)                                       |--------------------|
```

**Key Dependencies**

1. **Governance charter** must be approved before **Quality rules** can be enforced.  
2. **Edge gateways** must be deployed before **API gateway** can ingest data.  
3. **Model registry** must exist before **feedback loop** can be automated.  
4. **Automation scripts** for pipelines rely on the **CI/CD** framework established in Phase 2.

## 5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Severity | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|------|------------|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| 1 | Data silos persist | Medium | High | 4 | Conduct data inventory; enforce master model | Data Architect |
| 2 | Edge node latency > 5 s | Low | Medium | 3 | Deploy 5G edge nodes; test latency | IT Ops Lead |
| 3 | Security breach of telemetry | Medium | High | 5 | Zero‑trust network; MFA; regular penetration testing | Security Officer |
| 4 | Data quality drift | High | Medium | 4 | Auto‑drift detection; retraining schedule | Data Steward |
| 5 | Governance council inertia | Low | Medium | 3 | Executive sponsorship; clear charter | CDO |
| 6 | Regulatory non‑compliance (GDPR, HIPAA) | Medium | High | 5 | PIAs; privacy by design; audit trail | Compliance Officer |
| 7 | Budget overrun | Medium | Medium | 4 | Stage‑gate budget reviews; cost‑benefit ROI | PMO |
| 8 | Talent shortage (ML, edge devs) | High | Medium | 4 | Upskill programs; partner with vendors | Training Manager |

**Risk Matrix (Color‑coded)**  
- **Red**: Immediate action (R1, R3, R6)  
- **Yellow**: Monitor & plan (R2, R4, R5, R7, R8)
