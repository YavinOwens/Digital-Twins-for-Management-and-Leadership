# Digital Twin Project Management Specification  
*Enterprise Digital Twin Initiative – 17 Sep 2025*  

---

## Executive Summary  

Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical assets, processes, or entire systems that ingest real‑time telemetry, model behavior, and provide actionable insights.  The Enterprise Digital Twin Initiative (EDTI) will deliver a cloud‑native, data‑centric platform that ingests millions of device events per day, stores them in an immutable data lake, transforms them through a Delta‑Lake‑based ETL pipeline, and exposes curated, analytics‑ready tables in Synapse.  Predictive models, anomaly detectors, and simulation engines will run on Azure Machine Learning and be served via Azure API Management.  

This project management specification defines the governance, resources, timeline, risk, quality, communication, change, budget, stakeholder, documentation, delivery, and operational procedures required to execute the initiative successfully.  It is built around an agile, cross‑functional delivery model, leveraging Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Databricks, Synapse, Purview, and Azure Monitor.  The specification references the Digital Twin Data Engineering Specification, Analytics & Machine Learning Specification, and Enterprise Data Architecture Specification supplied in the context.

## 1. Project Governance  

| Governance Layer | Role | Responsibilities | Decision Frequency |
|------------------|------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Executive Steering Committee** | CIO, CTO, Head of Digital Transformation | Approve budget, set high‑level strategy, sign off on major releases | Quarterly |
| **Project Management Office (PMO)** | Technical Project Manager | Day‑to‑day oversight, risk tracking, stakeholder coordination | Weekly |
| **Architecture Review Board (ARB)** | Solution Architect, Data Architect | Validate technical designs, enforce standards, approve architecture changes | Bi‑weekly |
| **Security & Compliance Review Board (SCRB)** | Security Lead, Compliance Officer | Review security design, data classification, audit readiness | Monthly |
| **Change Advisory Board (CAB)** | Release Manager, QA Lead | Approve configuration changes, release approvals | As needed |
| **Data Governance Council** | Data Stewards, Purview Admin | Enforce data cataloging, lineage, retention, quality policies | Ongoing |

### Decision‑Making Processes  

1. **Sprint Planning & Review** – Held every two weeks.  All cross‑functional teams (data engineering, data science, API, security, ops) attend.  Backlog items are refined, estimated (Story Points), and prioritized by the Product Owner.  
2. **Architecture Sign‑Off** – Before any new service or major change, the ARB reviews the design document, validates against the reference architecture, and issues a sign‑off.  
3. **Security Review** – SCRB reviews all new code and infrastructure changes for compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001.  
4. **Release Approval** – CAB reviews the release notes, test results, and risk assessment; if no blockers, the release is approved.  

All decisions are logged in Azure Boards, and meeting minutes are stored in Confluence.  A decision log is maintained to ensure traceability.
